# HTML, JavaScript, and CSS certificate-generator

This program is an HTML document that contains a form with various input fields, including text fields, a select field, and a textarea. It also includes a button and a canvas element.

The form is styled with a CSS stylesheet, which applies some spacing and formatting to the form elements.

The behavior of the form is specified with a JavaScript script. The script includes a function called `generateImage` that is called when the button is clicked. The function gets the values of the form elements and draws them onto the canvas element.

To use this program, simply open the HTML file in a web browser. Enter some values into the form fields and click the "Generate Image" button to see the form data drawn onto the canvas.
